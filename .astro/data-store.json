It was blinking, constantly blinking, like it was taunting me.\n\nSome of my PHPUnit tests were crashing unexpectedly while trying to generate code coverage. There was no exception, no error message, no stack trace—nothing. The coverage report was never created and the PHP process was exiting silently with code `143`.\n\nWhat the actual 🤬?\n\nThis is a story about **extreme PHP debugging**—when standard PHP debugging tools fail and you need to dive deep into PHP's internals using custom debug binaries, Docker containers, and the GNU Debugger (GDB) to track down crashes that occur at the C level.\n\nSo, first things first. How can you debug your tests, or even PHPUnit in such a case? The answer is easy. You don’t because you can’t. Such behavior alludes that something quite sinister lurks in your code. Something that crashes deep inside PHP’s code. A statement, whose existence, creates a fatal error.\n\nBut we aren’t here to talk about what you can’t do. We are here to talk about what you can, actually, do.\n\n## Advanced PHP Debugging Techniques\n\nI’ve lost count how many times I stumbled across a similar issue. Normally, I would totally ignore the issue. I would try my tests one by one in order to determine which one is the problematic. I would surrender, had I not been able to pinpoint the problematic piece of code. But I am not that person and I suspect that you aren’t that person as well. So… Let’s debug it.\n\nFor starters, you can’t debug PHP with pre-compiled PHP binaries. You have to properly configure and compile your own binaries! And since we’ll need a whole toolchain for this, let’s Dockerize it.\n\n> I’m using Debian for this Docker image, but feel free to use the linux flavor you prefer.\n\n## 👶 Baby Steps\n\n```dockerfile\nFROM debian:bullseye-slim\nWORKDIR /php\n```\n\nWe, obviously, need to install the minimum set of dependencies to build PHP, so let’s have a look at the [official repo](https://github.com/php/php-src#readme):\n\n```dockerfile\nRUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y pkg-config build-essential \\\n    autoconf bison re2c libxml2-dev libsqlite3-dev\n```\n\nWe need to fetch the source for the PHP version we want to build. Luckily, we will not have to `git clone` PHP’s repo, since PHP offers source code [downloads](https://www.php.net/downloads.php) in their page. We’ll use PHP 7.4.33 and we need a way to download it into our image. Unfortunately `wget` is not installed in `bullseye-slim` so we’ll have to `apt-get` it as well.\n\nSo, we’ll go to the previous step where we are fetching PHP’s dependencies and we’ll add `wget` as well.\n\nAfter doing so, we are ready to download PHP:\n\n```dockerfile\nRUN wget -nv https://www.php.net/distributions/php-7.4.33.tar.gz && \\\n    tar xzf php-7.4.33.tar.gz\nWORKDIR /php/php-7.4.33\n```\n\nWe have downloaded, extracted and cd’d into PHP’s source! Now what? We’ll have to generate the configuration and configure the build prior to compiling:\n\n```dockerfile\nRUN ./buildconf -f\n```\n\nAt this point, we are ready to configure and compile PHP 7.4.33. However, this isn’t a simple, copy snippet / paste snippet, case.\n\n1. You have to know how you want to configure your binaries.\n2. You have to know which PHP extensions your code requires.\n3. You have to know whether to enable or disable something.\n\nAnd this is a process of thinking, reading, trying and failing, until you succeed.\n\nSo, build your image, create a container and open a shell into it. Your working directory will be the one where PHP’s sources lie. Type `./configure --help | more` and read through the extensive list of configuration options. A minimum debug build requires the flag `--enable-debug`.\n\nHowever, in my case, and most probably in yours as well, you’ll need some other stuff too. Such as cURL, sockets or intl. And in order to set up these, you’ll have some [fun](https://dwarffortresswiki.org/index.php/DF2014:Losing).\n\n## 🛠️ Configuring and Building PHP\n\nMake a list of the extensions you need included and features you need enabled (or disabled). **DO NOT ADD THE CONFIGURE OPTIONS TO THE DOCKERFILE, YET.**\n\n> I repeat, DO NOT ADD THEM TO THE DOCKERFILE, YET!\n\nYou remember me telling you, to open a shell into the container you built? The reason you need it, is because you will have to **fetch the extensions’ dependencies**.\n\n> Didn’t I tell you that this is going to be fun?\n\n```shell\n./configure --enable-fpm \\\n    --enable-debug \\\n    --with-openssl \\\n    --with-zlib \\\n    --with-curl \\\n    --enable-gd \\\n    --with-gettext \\\n    --enable-intl \\\n    --with-ldap \\\n    --with-mysqli \\\n    --enable-pcntl \\\n    --enable-sockets \\\n    --enable-sysvmsg \\\n    --with-xsl \\\n    --with-zip \\\n    --enable-mbstring \\\n    --with-pdo-mysql \\\n    --disable-short-tags\n```\n\nThe configure script is going to perform some checks and crash at some point or another, complaining about not being able to find some development dependencies. If it can’t find `ldap` you’ll probably have to `apt-get install libldap-dev`. If it can’t find Oniguruma, you’ll (not obviously, but probably) have to install `libonig-dev`. Rinse and repeat. Use common sense, apt-cache search and Google, in order to determine what you actually need.\n\nWhen you have gathered every package you have to install, you’ll have to modify your Dockerfile so that they get fetched, before you even attempt to configure PHP.\n\nBefore venturing forth, run a `make clean && make -j${nproc} && make install`. Just in case. If everything went well, `php -v` should give you output, stating it’s version and that it is a `NTS DEBUG` build.\n\n> #EverythingIsAwesome.\n\nAt this point, we’ll also need xdebug. You know the drill. Grab its source in `tar.gz` format from xdebug’s downloads page, bring it into the container and extract it is its own directory. `phpize`, `configure`, `make`.\n\nWhen everything is tested in the container you are working, you should move everything into your Dockerfile. It should look something like this:\n\n```dockerfile\nFROM debian:bullseye-slim\n\nRUN apt-get update && \\\n    apt-get upgrade && \\\n    apt-get install pkg-config build-essential autoconf bison re2c wget gdb \\\n    libxml2-dev libsqlite3-dev libonig-dev libz-dev \\\n    libssl-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev libzip-dev libpng-dev \\\n    libldap-dev libxslt-dev\n\nWORKDIR /php\n# Download PHP & xdebug\nRUN wget -nv https://www.php.net/distributions/php-7.4.33.tar.gz && \\\n    tar xzf php-7.4.33.tar.gz && \\\n    wget -nv https://xdebug.org/files/xdebug-3.1.6.tgz && \\\n    tar xzf xdebug-3.1.6.tgz\n\n# Build PHP\nWORKDIR /php/php-7.4.33\n\nRUN mkdir -p /usr/local/etc/php/conf.d/\n\nRUN ./buildconf -f && \\\n    ./configure --enable-fpm \\\n    --enable-debug \\\n    --with-openssl \\\n    --with-zlib \\\n    --with-curl \\\n    --enable-gd \\\n    --with-gettext \\\n    --enable-intl \\\n    --with-ldap \\\n    --with-mysqli \\\n    --enable-pcntl \\\n    --enable-sockets \\\n    --enable-sysvmsg \\\n    --with-xsl \\\n    --with-zip \\\n    --enable-mbstring \\\n    --with-pdo-mysql \\\n    --disable-short-tags \\\n    --with-config-file-scan-dir=/usr/local/etc/php/conf.d/ && \\\n    make clean && \\\n    make -j${nproc} && \\\n    make install\n\n# Build xdebug\nWORKDIR /php/xdebug-3.1.6\n\nRUN phpize && \\\n    ./configure --enable-xdebug && \\\n    make -j${nproc} && \\\n    make install\n\nRUN mkdir -p /var/www/html/\n\nWORKDIR /var/www/html\n```\n\n## Debugging PHP Crashes with GDB\n\nIf you are observant enough, you’ll already have noticed that I added [`gdb`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Debugger) in the packages I am fetching into our image. We’ll need the GNU debugger in order to make PHP crash, then investigate why it crashed.\n\nBut before even attempting this, we’ll have to properly configure PHP. php.ini and the likes.\n\nYou’ll need, at least, to increase the `memory_limit`, to enable xdebug and to set `xdebug.mode` to `coverage`. If you are still reading me, you’ll probably have guessed (correctly) that I’ll tell you to **R**ead **T**he **F**ine **M**anual, on how to do such things. Yes, I know that you can spam `-d` flags to PHP, however I highly suggest to craft a `php.ini` and an `xdebug.ini` (and each and every other .ini for each and every other extension you need configured).\n\nAnd (not only that, but mostly) that is the reason, you will definately need a `docker-compose.yaml`. You’ll have to mount your project at `/var/www/html` and you’ll have to mount the directory containing your PHP configuration at `/usr/local/etc/php/conf.d/`\n\nIs your container ready yet?\n\nOpen a shell into it…\n\n\u003Chr/>\n\nI cannot say that I am a debugging expert, nor that I navigate through gdb’s commands with ease. I usually work on a _need-to-know_ basis; Google is my best friend. So, unfortunately, this cannot be a gdb tutorial. But I can, at this point, give you some insight into what’s going on.\n\nAssuming that everything went fine, your cursor should be blinking and waiting to do thy bidding. Type `gdb php` in order to load PHP into the debugger and watch the cursor blink again. We’ll actually need to run something. In my case I have to `r ./vendor/bin/phpunit --coverage-clover=clover.xml`\n\n> # And it crashed… 🤬\n\nNow, we’ll have to figure out why it crashes. Let’s type `bt` in order to examine the [stack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_stack)… Get a [cheat sheet](https://gist.github.com/rkubik/b96c23bd8ed58333de37f2b8cd052c30#file-cheat_sheet-txt-L18) and happy hunting!\n\n\u003Chr/>\n\nIt took me hours to understand what the problem was. PHP was actually trying to perform an invalid operation. I not only had to examine the stack and functions’ parameters. I had PHP’s source code, side by side with my debugger, trying to understand what each line was doing.\n\nEventually, after hours and hours of examing the values of structures and pointers, reading through C code and trying to follow the execution path, I pinpointed the source of all evil. It was a relatively safe `shell_exec`, hidden in a destructor. It seems that, somehow; don’t ask, I never understood; PHP tried to execute this destructor and then all hell broke loose.\n\nMoral of the story? I should have listened to [Psalm](https://psalm.dev/), when it warned me that this piece of code was [forbidden](https://psalm.dev/docs/running_psalm/issues/ForbiddenCode/). But more importantly, when standard PHP debugging tools fail, you now know how to build custom PHP debug binaries, use GDB to trace crashes, and debug PHP internals at the C level.\n\n## Key Takeaways\n\n- **Custom PHP debug binaries** are essential for debugging crashes in PHP internals\n- **Docker** provides an isolated environment for building and debugging PHP from source\n- **GDB (GNU Debugger)** allows you to trace crashes and examine the call stack at the C level\n- **Xdebug** must be compiled from source when building custom PHP binaries\n- **Static analysis tools** like Psalm can help prevent these issues before they occur\n- When PHPUnit crashes silently, the problem often lies in PHP's C internals, not your PHP code\n\nThis extreme PHP debugging approach isn't for everyday issues, but when you're facing crashes that standard PHP debugging tools can't handle, building custom PHP debug binaries and using GDB is your path forward.","src/content/blog/extreme-debugging-in-php.md",[45],"../../assets/php-gdb.webp","76b23067762829b2",{"html":48,"metadata":49},"\u003Cp>It was one of those awkward, lonely and quiet nights.

A world where Garkham, Grand Master of the Black Magicians, has sworn to take possession of the Book of Hexplore. From this moment, the whole world is in great peril.

Now _that’s_ what I call a gaming setup!\n\nNostalgia aside, it’s a game I spent countless hours playing, fighting monsters and solving riddles and puzzles.

Over the years, I’ve revisited it occasionally &mdash; not just for nostalgia, but for its unique design and gameplay.\n\nUnfortunately, even with its GOG re-release, the game feels nearly unplayable on modern systems. It was designed for 640x480 resolution with 256 colors, and as you can imagine, running that on a 32-inch 4K monitor is far from ideal.\n\nSo, I thought:\n\n> _Can I do something about it?_\n\nBeing me, with my crazy ideas about impossible things, I figured I _might_ be able to make the game playable again. Unfortunately, this is a long and difficult project that could take years, and the most likely outcome is that it may never be finished. But I’ve started. And this is my journal of reverse engineering a 90s game.\n\n## First things first: Baby Steps\n\nIt’s been a very long time since I last touched C++ or read x86 Assembly. To tackle a project like this, you not only need a copy of [Ghidra](https://ghidra-sre.org/), but you also need to know a thing or two about how those ~~magnificent~~ hellish machines, operating systems, and APIs work. Being a firm believer in RTFM[^1], I knew I had to start by getting my hands on some good documentation.\n\n> Enter the world of software archaeology\n\nHexplore was released in August 1998, the same year as Windows 98. Given that the company that developed the game was formed around [1996](https://rpgwatch.com/developers/heliovisions-productions-1069.html) and that the typical development cycle for a game was around one year[^2], I estimate that it took about 12 to 18 months to develop. So, we can safely say that development likely began in late 1996 or early 1997.\n\nAssuming they used whatever cutting-edge technology was available at the time, we can make the following guesses:\n\n1. There was no [MMX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MMX_(instruction_set)) or [3DNow!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3DNow!); the world ran on the good old x86-32 instruction set.\n2. Development was likely done on Windows 95/NT4, as both were released in 1995.\n3. The code was probably written in Visual C++ 4.0, which was released in late 1995.\n4. The game probably uses Microsoft's DirectX 5.0.\n\nFor the time being, we need the following resources:\n\n- [x86 Instruction Set](https://www.felixcloutier.com/x86/) (_I don’t suggest Intel’s or AMD’s PDFs, as they are ginormous._)\n- [Win32 API](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/)\n- [DirectX 5 Documentation](https://library.thedatadungeon.com/directx5/)\n\nAlso, I should get a [book](https://www.amazon.com/x64-Assembly-Language-Step-Step-dp-1394155247/dp/1394155247) or [two](https://www.amazon.com/Learn-Program-Assembly-Foundational-Programmers/dp/1484274369/) on x86 Assembly. Besides the instruction set, I need to understand how things work in order to reverse-engineer and rewrite them effectively.\n\nAnd thus, armed with the forbidden manuscripts, patience, and a cup of coffee, I'll delve into the ancient art of reverse engineering. For it is not enough to merely read the cryptic runes of `REPNE SCASB ES:EDI` from dusty tomes of knowledge; no, I must grasp their very essence, to unweave the fabric of the machine and forge it anew in a higher tongue. Only then can I hope to resurrect the relics of the past, breathing life into the forgotten code once more.\n\n## The lair of Ghidra\n\nFor the record, let me state that I am not a beginner in either reverse engineering or assembly. I had a pretty solid knowledge of how _stuff_ works. And I’m using the past tense because I haven’t touched either assembly or reverse engineering in a very long time. Yet, I still remember a trick or two.\n\nGhidra, besides being a [disassembler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disassembler), is also a [decompiler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decompiler). It can not only translate machine code into Assembly, but it can also (try to) reconstruct a C representation of the program we are working on. This is both a curse and a blessing.\n\n### Blessings\n\nIt’s a blessing for those of us who can use our heads as a C interpreter &mdash; _shift by eight bits and **and** it with `0xff`_ &mdash; however, the following simple snippet requires a translator for those who are not accustomed to reading assembly:\n\n```assembly\nMOV ECX, 0x08\nSHR EAX, ECX\nMOV ECX, 0xff\nAND EAX, ECX\n```\n\n### ...and curses\n\nAnd it’s a curse, a terrible curse that can sometimes frustrate you so much that you’ll want to punch your shiny, curved screen right in the middle. I won’t tell you the reason before giving you a real-life example that I’ve come across countless times:\n\n```assembly\nMOV EDI, dword ptr [PTR_DAT_00590108]\nOR ECX, 0xffffffff\nXOR EAX, EAX\nMOV dword ptr [ESP + local_248], EDI\nREPNE SCASB ES:EDI\nNOT ECX\nDEC ECX\nMOV EBP, ECX\n```\n\nLet's see, what does this do?\n\nThe first four instructions are not a big deal; we load the value of a pointer into the `EDI` register, we\nset the `ECX` register to `0xffffffff`, we clear the `EAX` register and we move the value of `EDI` into our stack, on the position specifed by `ESP + local_248`. However, the fifth instruction is pretty interesting. It [scans](https://www.felixcloutier.com/x86/scas:scasb:scasw:scasd) a byte in `EDI` and compares it with the value stored in `AL`. It [repeats](https://www.felixcloutier.com/x86/rep:repe:repz:repne:repnz) that scanning until either the zero flag (`ZF`) is set or `ECX` is 0.\nDoes it start making sense?\n\nAfter scanning the string, it `NOT`s the `ECX` register and decrements it by one, effectively giving us the number of bytes the string contains, or simply `strlen`.\n\nBut why, Ghidra, doesn’t it simply translate this to `strlen` and instead translates it to (more or less) the following gibberish?\n\n```c\nuVar1 = 0xffffffff;\nlocal_248 = (WCHAR *)PTR_DAT_00590108;\npcVar10 = PTR_DAT_00590108;\ndo {\n    if (uVar1 == 0) break;\n    uVar1 = uVar1 - 1;\n    cVar7 = *pcVar10;\n    pcVar10 = pcVar10 + 1;\n} while (cVar7 != '\\0');\npCVar9 = (LPSTR)(~uVar1 - 1);\n```\n\nIt’s quite possible that the compiler performs aggressive optimization by inlining the `strlen` function (i.e., replacing the function call with the body of the function), which effectively eliminates the overhead of calling the function. Alternatively, it could be due to decompilation limitations, which may not map the assembly code directly to a function call. Whatever the case, we know that we cannot truly rely on the decompiler and definitely need to understand assembly.\n\nThat's where a reference to assembly instructions comes in handy &mdash; and more than that, it is the go-to resource when something doesn’t make any sense.\n\n## Verifying our claims\n\nAfter loading and analyzing the executable, we can see that Ghidra has identified a couple of VC++ library functions, such as `_strlen`, `_memcmp`, and `_rand`. This strongly indicates that the game was written in C/C++ and compiled with Microsoft's compiler. The exact version is not known, but it is likely one of Visual C++ 4.0, 5.0, or 6.0. And since the world hadn't yet discovered the marvels of [SIMD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_instruction,_multiple_data), we’ll be working with fewer instructions, fewer registers, and less complex stuff. _Everything is awesome!_\n\nBy navigating Ghidra's **Symbol Table**, we can see calls to `DirectDrawCreate` (that's DirectX's DirectDraw 😉), `DirectSoundCreate` (🎧), `_SmackOpen` (that's [Smacker Video](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smacker_video) 🎥), and various other Win32 API calls. Hexplore also uses [SecuROM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SecuROM), and I'm sure I'll find some code related to it as well.\n\nWith our resources ready to be consumed, the executable disassembled, and a fresh cup of coffee, we are ready to get into some serious software archaeology and reverse engineering. But before diving deep into the obscure world of x86, let's cover a few final things &mdash; which, I believe, I should have stated earlier in this post.\n\n## What now?\n\nAs you have undoubtedly guessed, this is the first part in a series of posts focused on both reverse engineering and the methods used to understand and re-implement something, as well as on the specific game &mdash; which I enjoyed playing both as a kid and as an adult. The posts will follow a _diary format_. I do not intend to write a book on RE, nor tutorials on the subject. I merely want to document a long journey I’ve decided to embark upon in order to expand my knowledge, have some fun tinkering with an old game, and, why not, produce something useful &mdash; either for myself or for others.\n\nThis journey had some milestones set from its inception stage &mdash;that is, when I first thought, _why not reverse engineer Hexplore?_. The first milestone has been reached: researching the resources I’ll need to start working on it. I might not know everything, and I am sure weird things will come up along the way, but I have a solid stash of information I can use to understand and re-implement the things I want to. Hexplore uses a [voxel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voxel) engine, which (most probably, needs to be verified) was implemented in software. Considering the limitations of the software and hardware that existed back then, everything was new: 32-bit Windows, DirectX, hardware accelerators (nVidia’s Riva, 3dfx’s Voodoo, and ATI’s RAGE are some examples) were just becoming affordable for home computers—you name it. _Could I re-implement this voxel engine in a modern API, say, Vulkan?_\n\nI honestly don't know. Thus, I’ve set the project's milestones and will try to reach them:\n\n- [X] Investigate the game and gather necessary resources for reverse engineering\n- [ ] Reverse engineer the game's data file formats and produce documentation for them\n- [ ] Craft tools for viewing (and possibly manipulating) the game's assets\n- [ ] Imagine something bigger.\n\nUnderstanding the game's data file formats, although it sounds simple, will be both a difficult and time-consuming task &mdash; as such, it must not be underestimated. I've already started looking into the files that hold the game's texts (i.e., the `st1` files) and made some progress, but that's a story for another post.\n\n## Closing words\n\nThe next time we meet, I'll be making a deep dive into the game's data file formats. Expect some frustration, as the developers have taken some clever measures against people like me (which is not unheard of). We'll also get our hands dirty with some C++, talk about developer decisions, and continue our journey into the abyss. And as those who have played Hexplore vividly remember:\n\n> You must gather your party before venturing forth.\n\n[^1]: Read(ing) the fucking manual.\n[^2]: id Software began working on Doom [after the release of Spear of Destiny](https://5years.doomworld.com/interviews/johnromero/), and the game was released on [December 10, 1993](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doom_(1993_video_game)).","src/content/blog/reverse-engineering-hexplore-1.md",[114,115],"../../assets/hexplore.webp","../../assets/hexplore-1.webp","ed452ad1f8075100",{"html":118,"metadata":119},"\u003Cp>Recently, I came across a game that’s nearly a quarter of a century old: \u003Ca href=\"https://www.gog.com/en/game/hexplore\">Hexplore\u003C/a>.

From operating systems to applications written for embedded systems, and from servers and services to ERPs and CRMs, each domain has its own quirks. I won't claim that video games belong to the toughest or weirdest domain—such a statement would be a blatant exaggeration. However, they are unique, both because of the constraints they impose on developers and the ways in which companies (and by extension, developers) get paid for them.\n\n## Mumbling\n\nWhile delving into how games generate profit is irrelevant to our current journey, understanding the constraints imposed on developers by the platform, available technology, and industry standards is crucial. As briefly discussed in my previous post, *Hexplore* was developed in the mid-'90s, when GPUs were not as advanced or widely accessible to home users, Pentium processors had just started dominating the market over older Intel/AMD/Cyrix models, CD-ROMs were relatively new, and hard drives were small and slow.\n\n| **Component** | **Requirement** |\n| :--------: | --------------------------------- |\n| **CPU** | Pentium 100MHz or _100% compatible_ |\n| **RAM** | 16 MB |\n| **CD-ROM** | 4x speed (600kb/s) |\n| **Sound** | Sound Blaster 16-bit or _compatible_ |\n| **GPU** | SVGA Video Card |\n| **OS**  | Windows 95/98 |\n\nThese are the system requirements for *Hexplore*. While they may seem irrelevant at first glance, they serve as a constant reminder to stop questioning why developers made certain decisions—this game is over a quarter of a century old. It's important to note that a Pentium running at 100MHz could execute at most two instructions per cycle[^1], but most of the time, it would execute just one. Additionally, some instructions take more than one cycle to complete, and access to EDO RAM was slow. When combined with the fact that Pentiums lacked many of the features modern processors boast (e.g., [out-of-order execution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Out-of-order_execution), [speculative execution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Out-of-order_execution), and [cache prefetching](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Out-of-order_execution)), execution speed becomes a critical factor. Simply put, 100MHz means the processor could perform 10\u003Csup>8\u003C/sup> [instruction cycles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instruction_cycle) per second—meaning each instruction cycle took roughly 10ns.\n\nThe Pentium was a single-core, single-thread CPU, meaning only one process could execute at any given time. Windows 95, however, was a true multitasking OS — it employed [preemptive multitasking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preemption_(computing)) to allow multiple processes to appear to run simultaneously. This is seamless to the user, as [time slices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preemption_(computing)#Time_slice) are calculated by the scheduler to meet the needs of each process. However, this adds extra overhead that developers had to take into account. Their applications had to compete with others for resources, so they needed to execute tasks efficiently to prevent users from experiencing lag or slow loading.\n\nMoreover, while the _10GB barrier_ was broken in 1997, a typical hard drive had a capacity of around 4GB—which had to store the OS, other applications, documents, and more. As a result, most games of the era offered players the option to perform a minimal installation, copying only essential files to the hard drive while loading the rest from the CD-ROM as needed. This extended loading times, but given the hardware limitations, it was the preferable option for most users. For context, a 1x CD-ROM speed was equivalent to 150kb/s—*Hexplore* required a 4x CD-ROM (or faster). A file from the game's first level, for example, is 2.1MB, so in an ideal scenario, it would take around 4 seconds to load.\n\nMany of us remember placing the mouse cursor at the tip of a progress bar, anxiously wondering if an installation had frozen—yes, loading times in the '90s were often a painful experience. This is why developers employed clever techniques to reduce overhead, improve speed and responsiveness, and squeeze the best performance possible out of the hardware we had at the time.\n\n## First steps\n\nWhen we [last left](https://mistericy.github.io/2024/09/20/Reverse-Engineering-Hexplore-My-Journey-Begins/) our adventurer, he was discussing the game's texts. While I was correct in assuming that the game's strings are stored in the `Gbtxt.st1` file, it took me quite some time to understand not only the file's structure but also how *Hexplore* uses it.\n\nThe first and most logical step was to search the file for a well-known string, like a game message or the name of an enemy. If you haven't met him yet, here's Glore:\n\n![A Glore, one of Garkham's Minions](../../assets/hexplore-glore.webp)\n\nGlores are described as *monstrous scum* and emit a vile laughter when you enter their line of sight and they decide to attack. While there are numerous references to glores in the game (hint: 18), I wasn't able to find any in the data file. The next logical step was to open the file with a hex editor and check for anything legible inside. However, I found no clues, as the file appeared entirely composed of garbage. Declaring it a dead end, I returned to Ghidra to continue reverse engineering the game.\n\nSearching for `.st1` in the **Defined Strings** window revealed one result: `txt.st1`. The fact that **Gb** is missing is pretty strange, hinting that we’re in for a surprise. This string is referenced *only twice* in the entire program (at least, that’s what Ghidra detected), so finding where the string loading and decrypting functionality occurs should be straightforward.\n\nUpon visiting the first location, we’re greeted by a long function. The first thing it does? It calls `sprintf` to generate a file path using the format: `%s\\%s%s`. The first argument is `\"common\"`—there’s our directory. The third argument is the `txt.st1` string. Logically, the middle argument should be `Gb`... but how?\n\nLet's make a deviation...\n\n## Detecting the Game's Language\n\nIf we backtrack a bit, we’ll notice a function call in `WinMain`, just before the game’s main loop begins. This function is called with a reference to a structure and, *I guess*, it performs some kind of initialization before allowing the game to proceed to the main loop. The function starts with a call to [`GetCurrentDirectoryA`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winbase/nf-winbase-getcurrentdirectory)—which is a curious choice. It stores the current directory in the aforementioned structure and then creates the following string:\n\n```c\nsprintf(buffer, \"%s\\\\%s\\\\??%s\", game->gameDir, \"common\", \"txt.st1\");\n```\n\nIt then immediately calls [`FindFirstFileA`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/fileapi/nf-fileapi-findfirstfilea):\n\n```c\nWIN32_FIND_DATAA findData;\nHANDLE hFindFile = FindFirstFileA(buffer, &findData);\nif (hFindFile != INVALID_HANDLE_VALUE) {\n  // We found something:\n  gameLanguage[0] = findData.cFileName[0];\n  gameLanguage[1] = findData.cFileName[1];\n  gameLanguage[2] = '\\0';\n}\n```\n\nSo, if the file were named `Gntxt.st1`, would the game's language be set to `Gn` (*hint: German*)? Oh yes, it would!\n\nThere’s little point in debating whether this decision was good or bad. It’s certainly an odd one, considering the developers could have chosen a more straightforward way to detect the game's language. For example, they could have written a value to the Windows Registry during the game’s installation.\n\nWhen the game starts, the memory location where the language will eventually be stored contains the string `XX`, which is then updated by this method. However, another curious decision stands out: the use of `GetCurrentDirectoryA`.\n\nAccording to Microsoft's documentation, this function *retrieves the current directory for the current process*. But what exactly is the current directory? While not explicitly explained in the documentation, it refers to the directory you're currently in when launching the application. For instance, if the game is installed in `C:\\Hexplore\\` and you open a command prompt at `C:\\` and run `.\\Hexplore\\hexplore.exe`, guess what? `GetCurrentDirectoryA` will return `C:\\`. You see where this is going?\n\nIf we try this little experiment, we’ll notice that *Hexplore* will fail to start, displaying a message box that reads **FILE ERROR: 5** along with the problematic file path (in our case, `C:\\common\\XXtxt.st1`).\n\nA better approach here would be to use [`GetModuleFileNameA`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/libloaderapi/nf-libloaderapi-getmodulefilenamea), which retrieves the actual path of the executable. With a bit of string manipulation, the correct path could be derived, and small bugs like this wouldn’t exist (*Note to future self: make it fail-proof when you start implementing it*).\n\n## Back to String Finding\n\nRight after setting the game's language, *Hexplore* calls the long function that greeted us earlier. As we discussed, it crafts the proper path to the file and stores it in a buffer. It then proceeds to check if the file exists and loads it into memory.\n\n```c\nvoid __cdecl LoadStringsFromDisk(LPCSTR fileName,char *data,int shouldDecryptStrings);\n```\n\nThis function does the following:\n\n- Retrieves a handle for the file.\n- Retrieves the file's size.\n- Allocates memory to store the file.\n- Reads the file.\n- Closes the file.\n\nAll steps use the Windows API to perform file operations.\n\nSubsequently, if the `shouldDecryptStrings` parameter is not equal to `0`, it proceeds with decrypting the data in place.\n\n*Hexplore* has an intricate and interesting way of accessing files, which will be analyzed in another post once I have completely figured it out. For the time being, what is important is to see how the decryption takes place.\n\n### Decryption\n\n```c\n// Simplified version of loading the data from disk:\nlong size = GetFileSize(handle);\nchar* data = (char*)malloc(size);\nReadData(handle, data, size);\n\nif (shouldDecryptStrings != 0) {\n  char key = 0x37; // Set the initial key\n  int i = 0; // Set the counter \n  while (i \u003C size) { // While there is data in the buffer\n    char temp = buffer[i] ^ key; // XOR the current character with the key\n    key = key + buffer[i] + 0x33; // Add 0x33, the current character, and the key to key\n    buffer[i] = temp; // Store the decrypted character\n    i++; // Increment the counter\n  }\n}\n```\n\nSince I had never encountered this type of encryption before, I did some research and found that it resembles a [Stream Cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stream_cipher).\n\nWhile I'm no expert on encryption, I’d like to share a few observations:\n\n1. This encryption implementation serves a dual purpose: on one hand, it adds a layer of complexity to the data, making it harder for players to modify the game or inadvertently break it while trying to mod it. On the other hand, it helps protect the game's integrity, ensuring that players experience the game as intended.\n2. The decryption process is quite efficient, as it performs a per-byte XOR operation, which is lightweight (_hint: takes 1 instruction cycle on the Pentium_). As mentioned earlier, in the realm of video games, speed and efficiency are crucial to prevent choppy gameplay or long loading times.\n3. The use of a dynamic key per byte introduces an additional layer of obfuscation that makes simple attacks more challenging. This prevents easy key prediction and makes brute-force attempts more difficult.\n4. While this method might seem simplistic by today's standards, it highlights the creative solutions game developers employed in the '90s to protect their games. Even simple encryption methods like this could deter casual modding and hacking efforts.\n\n## It's Decrypted, but It Still Makes No Sense\n\nAfter writing some quick and dirty code to decrypt the file and store it locally in its decrypted form, I opened it again with a hex editor to investigate its contents. While I was able to find _Glore_ and all of the strings used in the game, I was puzzled by the file's structure. It seems to have a header and contains much more data than just the game's strings. Since I was not able to find any information on the internet regarding this file format, I believe it is probably a proprietary format used exclusively for this game. [Heliovisions](https://www.mobygames.com/company/1859/doki-denki-sa/) released six games, and of those, only **two** were released for Windows. It is highly unlikely that they used this format in another game, and researching further into this matter seems futile. While one approach would be to look up the game's credits and search for other games created by *Hexplore*'s development team, it's uncertain that I would find anything. Thus...\n\nBack at Ghidra. Right after the call to `LoadStringsFromDisk`, there's another call whose first argument is a pointer to the unencrypted data. Interesting... Let’s follow it to see where it leads us.\n\n## `FUN_004160a0`\n\n```c\nvoid __cdecl FUN_004160a0(char *decryptedData,uint param_2,int *param_3)\n```\n\nFirst of all, the function performs a simple check to determine whether the pointer that contains the decrypted data is allocated. Subsequently, it checks if its first integer element equals `0x54585423`. Since X86 is [little-endian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endianness), this corresponds to `0x42545854`, or `BTXT` if translated to ASCII. Hey! I think we've found a header, since this seems like a [magic number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_format#Magic_number)! \n\nThe next check is against the 3rd integer in the decrypted data (`0x08`) and ensures that it is not equal to 0. _Definitely a header_. Finally, it checks if the third parameter isn’t `NULL` and that the second parameter is less than `100000000`.\n\n```x86asm\n; First check: Is the pointer allocated?\nMOV ESI, dword ptr [ESP + decryptedData]\nTEST ESI, ESI                   \nJZ return\n\n; Second check: Is the first four bytes of the header valid?\nMOV EAX, dword ptr [ESI]\nCMP EAX, 0x54585442\nJNZ return\n\n; Third check: Is the third element of the header not zero?\nMOV EAX, dword ptr [ESI + 0x08]\nTEST EAX, EAX\nJZ return\n\n; Fourth check: Is the third parameter of the function allocated? \nMOV ECX, dword ptr [ESP + param_3]\nTEST ECX, ECX\nJZ return\n\n; Fifth check: Is the second parameter less than 100000000?\nMOV EDX, dword ptr [ESP + param_2]\nCMP EDX, 0x5f5e0ff\nJA return\n```\n\nWith these clues so far, we can deduce that the file does have a header, so we will continue investigating the function to determine how long the header is, from which fields it is composed, and what values they have. Moving on, the function performs some initialization of `param_3`:\n\n\n```x86asm\nMOV dword ptr [ECX],0x0\nMOV dword ptr [ECX + 0x4],0x0\nMOV dword ptr [ECX + 0x8],0xffffffff\n```\n\nIt seems that `param_3` is a structure which might look like the following:\n\n```c\ntypedef struct {\n  void* unknown1;\n  void* unknown2;\n  int unknown3;\n} UnknownStruct;\n```\n\nSubsequently, the function runs the following code:\n\n```x86asm\n; Load into EDI the fourth field of the header\nMOV EDI, dword ptr [ESI + 0xc]\n; Load into EBP the third field of the header\nMOV EBP, dword ptr [ESI + 0x8]\n; Add the base address of the decryptedData pointer into EDI\n; Now EDI points to another address, which means that the fourth\n; field of the header is an address within the file\nADD EDI, ESI\n```\n\nAlrighty! Back to the hex editor! The file's value at position `0xC` is `0x0000001C`. This means that now, `EDI` points to wherever the pointer is located in memory, plus `1C` (or 28 in decimal) bytes ahead of the pointer's start. Thus, this strengthens our belief that this field in the header contains an address inside the file where something begins. The value at `1C` is `0x00000000`, so we don't have anything solid yet. Let's continue:\n\n```x86asm\n; Load the third field of the header into EBX\nMOV EBX, EBP\n; Divide EBX by two\nSHR EBX, 1\n; Load into EAX the contents of the address pointed to by \n; EDI (currently at 1C) plus EBP times four.\nLEA EAX, [EDI + EBP * 0x4]\n```\n\n`EBP` stores the data found in the third field of the header. By examining the file, we’ll notice that this value is `0x52C` (or 1324 in decimal). Subsequently, `EBX` stores its half, which is `0x296` (or 662 in decimal). Finally, `EAX` is loaded with the value found at the address pointed to by `EDI` (wherever the pointer lies, plus `0x1C`) plus `0x14B0`, resulting in `0x14CC`.\n\nConveniently, the fifth field of the header contains the value `0x14CC`. Therefore, this must be another address, either the beginning of a section or the end of a section, since the file contains much more data beyond that address. As this starts to look like a pattern, I had to investigate the values of what I thought was the header.\n\n```c\ntypedef struct {\n  int magic;  // Always 'BTXT' \n  int unknown1; // 0x100\n  int unknown2; // 0x52c\n  int unknown3; // 0x1c\n  int unknown4; // 0x14cc\n  int unknown5; // 0x52dc\n  int unknown6; // 0x297c\n} st1header;\n```\n\nI first went to `0x14CC`, which is a strong lead since it appears both in the file and in the calculation in the code. The value at that position is `0x52DC`... Wait, what? A quick jump to `0x52DC` reveals the value `0x72745300`. However, I can see in my hex editor that the string **Strength:** appears, followed by a NUL character. I jumped back to `0x14D0`, which contained the value `0x52DD` where the **Strength:** string begins, and I wondered, *does the pattern continue*?\n\n- `0x14D4` contains the value `0x52E7` => **Mechanism** followed by a NUL character.\n- `0x14D8` contains the value `0x52F1` => **Incantation** followed by a NUL character.\n\nThe last string can be found at address `0x15898`, so by looking for that value in the file, we’d probably find where it is stored. The search reveals that this is found at address `0x2978`, which is strangely close to the value stored in the `unknown6` field in the header. As such, we can deduce that:\n\n1. At `0x001C`, an unknown section starts.\n2. At `0x14CC`, a section that contains addresses of the real strings starts.\n3. At `0x297C`, another unknown section starts.\n4. At `0x52DC`, the strings section starts.\n\n\n```c\ntypedef struct {\n  int magic;  // Always 'BTXT' \n  int unknown1; // 0x100\n  int unknown2; // 0x52c\n  int addrUnknown1; // 0x1c\n  int addrStringLocationStart;\n  int addrStringStart; // 0x52dc\n  int addrUnknown2; // 0x297c\n} st1header;\n```\n\n> It’s four in the morning, and I think it’s time for me to sleep. I’m probably killing off the few healthy brain cells I have left, trying to figure out how this thing works. \n> #GiveMeMoreAssembly.\n\n```x86asm\n; Compare EDI (ptr + 0x1C) with EAX (ptr + 0x14CC)\nCMP EDI, EAX\n; Load into EBX the value stored at EDI (ptr + 0x1C)\n; plus EBX multiplied by 4 (to get the correct offset)\nLEA EBX, [EDI + EBX * 0x4]\nJNC return\n```\n\n![Where we currently stand](../../assets/st1-file-structure-1.png)\n\n```x86asm\nLAB_0041610a:\n; Load the contents pointed to by EBX into ECX\nMOV ECX, dword ptr [EBX]\n; Compare the value in ECX with EDX (param_2)\nCMP ECX, EDX\n; If they are equal, jump to LAB_0041612d\nJZ LAB_0041612d\nJLE LAB_00416116\n; Load EBX into EAX for further processing\nMOV EAX, EBX\nJMP LAB_00416119\n\n```\n\nNow we are getting somewhere! First and foremost, we identified that `param_2` is used for matching something from the *Unknown 1* area, so it must be important for the game and will most likely give us more answers. Instead of continuing to read assembly, we'll perform some **speculative execution** and assume that we have a match; thus, we are going to jump to `LAB_0041612d`. \n\nThe _we have a match_ code is pretty straightforward and reveals even more information about the structure of the file and the algorithm that is used to search for a string inside the strings file. Firstly, it uses the address of `EBP`, which is the address of the matching element, and adds to it the third field of the structure multiplied by 4, in order to access the **String Locations Area**. From that point, it reads the value at the given location and resolves it to find the string, setting the pointer &mdash; the first field of the structure found in `param_3` &mdash; to the actual string. Subsequently, it finds the relevant position in the **Unknown 2 Area** and sets the next two fields of the structure to the values found in the file.\n\nAs such, we can make the following observations:\n\n1. The **Unknown 1 Area** contains the String IDs sorted in ascending order; thus, `param_2` is the ID of the string we want to retrieve.\n2. The third parameter of the function is a structure that contains a pointer to the actual string and extra data obtained from the file. The **Unknown 2 Area** contains this extra data.\n3. The header of the file and the structure containing the information we want look like the following:\n\n```c\ntypedef struct {\n  int magic;      // Always 'BTXT'\n  int unknown;    // 0x100, probably version or other flags\n  int nEntries;   // Number of strings in the file\n  int addrIdx;    // Address of the index section\n  int addrStrLoc; // Address of the strings location section\n  int addrStrSec; // Address of the strings section\n  int addrExtra;  // Address of extra data section    \n} StringTableHeader;\n\ntypedef struct {\n  char* string;   // Pointer to the actual string\n  int unknown1;   // Unknown extra data\n  int unknown2;   // Unknown extra data\n} StringEntry;\n```\n\n## Verifying Our Claims\n\nLet's say that we are looking for the string with ID = `45141`. The game will perform a binary search (which is *fast*) to determine where this value is located in the Index Section. When it does, it will add `0x14B0` (or the number of entries * 4) to move the the Strings Location Section in order to find where the string is located in the file. It will extract the string (and the extra data found at `0x297C` plus the position of the index in the Index Section) and return a `StringEntry` structure:\n\n![Do you want to recruit this warrior?](../../assets/hexplore-warrior-1.webp)\n\n> It's time to settle the score with Garkham and his army of monstrous glores. \n> I am a powerful and brave-hearted warrior. I would like to offer my services to your band!\n\nThe most interesting part of this approach is that when Hexplore requires loading a string for displaying, it only needs 12 bytes of memory since it does not copy the string to the `StringEntry` structure but uses a _reference_ to its location in the `decryptedData`! Talk about optimizations and resource conservation!\n\nArmed with all this information, I can start working on something solid &mdash; a library to read and write the String Table (I guess that `st1` means *String Table version 1*), which can be used both in the development of a tool (for modding) and for the recreation of the engine, should I ever decide to pursue it.\n\n## What's Next\n\nOne milestone down, many more to go! There are many more file types to understand, document, and manipulate, among which are:\n\n1. `sb0` files, which contain textures.\n2. `vb1` files, which contain 3D assets.\n3. `bin` files, which contain information about levels, maps, heroes, and other game-related data.\n4. `sbk` files, which contain music and sound samples.\n5. `sav` files, which contain save data.\n\nHowever, things are going to get serious since I'll have to reverse engineer the graphics engine, the sound engine, and the game engine to understand these data files. Maybe not in their entirety, but I'll need to have a very clear picture of how they work and how they use the files and the data that resides in them to perform the same work as I did here.\n\nI am not entirely sure what I will settle on; for the time being, I'm just moving around, reverse engineering here and there, and documenting things. Maybe I'll have something solid the next time we speak, maybe I won't. However, one thing is certain: The process is underway.","src/content/blog/reverse-engineering-hexplore-2.md",[183,184,185,186],"../../assets/hexplore-glore.webp","../../assets/st1-file-structure-1.png","../../assets/hexplore-warrior-1.webp","../../assets/hexplore-2.webp","b657f32f6712c4ce",{"html":189,"metadata":190},"\u003Cp>Video games are a unique kind of beast in the realm of software development—\u003Cem>aren’t they all?\u003C/em> you might ask, and you’d be right.

While they may seem irrelevant at first glance, they serve as a constant reminder to stop questioning why developers made certain decisions—this game is over a quarter of a century old. It’s important to note that a Pentium running at 100MHz could execute at most two instructions per cycle[^1], but most of the time, it would execute just one. Additionally, some instructions take more than one cycle to complete, and access to EDO RAM was slow. When combined with the fact that Pentiums lacked many of the features modern processors boast (e.g., \u003Ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Out-of-order_execution\">out-of-order execution\u003C/a>, \u003Ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Out-of-order_execution\">speculative execution\u003C/a>, and \u003Ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Out-of-order_execution\">cache prefetching\u003C/a>), execution speed becomes a critical factor. Simply put, 100MHz means the processor could perform 10\u003Csup>8\u003C/sup> \u003Ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instruction_cycle\">instruction cycles\u003C/a> per second—meaning each instruction cycle took roughly 10ns.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The Pentium was a single-core, single-thread CPU, meaning only one process could execute at any given time. Windows 95, however, was a true multitasking OS — it employed \u003Ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preemption_(computing)\">preemptive multitasking\u003C/a> to allow multiple processes to appear to run simultaneously. This is seamless to the user, as \u003Ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preemption_(computing)#Time_slice\">time slices\u003C/a> are calculated by the scheduler to meet the needs of each process. However, this adds extra overhead that developers had to take into account.

As a result, most games of the era offered players the option to perform a minimal installation, copying only essential files to the hard drive while loading the rest from the CD-ROM as needed. This extended loading times, but given the hardware limitations, it was the preferable option for most users. For context, a 1x CD-ROM speed was equivalent to 150kb/s—\u003Cem>Hexplore\u003C/em> required a 4x CD-ROM (or faster).

The *Minister of Finance* wouldn't approve the purchase of a new one... (*sigh*)\n\nSo... I tried what the docs said. *Failed*. Read more. *Failed more*.

Replied to some Asana comments. Back to the implementation. Threw a couple of `curl` requests to no avail. Sent a message to a colleague about an unrelated matter. Back to Asana. Back to `curl`.\n\nOh, 🤬. I'll fix it tomorrow.\n\nTomorrow never came.\n\n## The Anatomy of Productive Procrastination\n\nHere's the thing about productive procrastination: it's **worse than doomscrolling**. At least when you're scrolling throughout Reddit, you know you're procrastinating. You can see it. You can understand it. But *productive procrastination*? It gives you a sense of &laquo;*Hey! I do things*&raquo; or &laquo;*I am working*&raquo; or even &laquo;*I'm not procrastinating*&raquo;.\n\n It keeps you away from your goals and priorities while letting you pretend you're being productive.\n\n The Asana comments. The colleague messages. The email mental notes. All of it feels like work. All of **it is work**, technically. But it's not the work that **matters**.\n\n When I'm frustrated by something (some examples are a badly documented API, a task that's extremely boring, a user story that makes no sense, a project that has no purpose) I do other things. And on those days when I'm feeling self-destructive? Just the feeling of it is enough to send me spiraling into productive procrastination.\n\nThe triggers? As predictable as the fact that *it works on my machine*:\n\n- Badly documented APIs (or worse, APIs documented by someone juggling three remote jobs who needed to show progress on all of them before their 2 PM standup)\n- Soul-crushing, mind-mashing boring tasks that make me wonder why I didn't become a plumber &mdash; at least then I'd get to save the princess\n- User stories that read like they were written by a Soviet-era bureaucratic committee: five people involved, none of them understand the problem, all of them have to approve\n- And sometimes, just sometimes, the impostor syndrome whispering that *I'm not good enough anyway*, so **why you even bother bro?**\n\n## The Positive Feedback Loop (3.6 Roentgen, Not Great, Not Terrible)\n\nLet's talk about the self-destructive behavior, because pretending it doesn't exist won't make it go away.\n\nIt's the combination of impostor syndrome &mdash; that thing [over half of us feel](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03966) but won't admit &mdash; in conjunction with an *I'm not good enough* mentality. It's a self-fulfilling prophecy in a positive feedback loop. The more frustrated you get, the more you believe you can't do it. The more you believe you can't do it, the more you procrastinate. The more you procrastinate, the more frustrated you get.\n\nRinse. Repeat. Spiral.\n\nThis is where the difference between 3PM and 3AM becomes crystal clear.\n\nAt 3PM, with a ton of things running, cars passing by, neighbors screaming, my first-born crying that she wants to watch some Peppa Pig &mdash; IT'S A NIGHTMARE. There are deadlines, meetings, messages, interruptions. The frustration compounds. If it doesn't work in 10 minutes, I can skip to the next important thing. Procrastinating the one that usually matters.\n\nAt 3AM? When the baby wakes me up for a reason or another and I can't fall back asleep? That's different.\n\nAt 3AM, when there's time and space to meditate on the problem, work becomes meditative. The serenity of the city that sleeps soundly. Some lo-fi or psybient playing quietly. The cold outside, or the warmth &mdash; doesn't matter. What matters is the silence, the lack of competing priorities, the absence of pressure.\n\nNo race conditions between my brain and seventeen Slack notifications. Just me, the code, and a singular focus.\n\nAt 3AM, those boring tasks that would make me punch the screen at 3PM? They feel like jacking into the Matrix. Pure focus. Pure flow.\n\nI am nocturnal. I've accepted this.\n\n## Breaking Through the Wall (One Brick at a Time)\n\nSo how do you actually push through when the frustration hits and tomorrow keeps not coming?\n\nStay a while and listen.\n\n### The 30 Minute Rule\n\nGive it 30 minutes. If you have no results, or only bad results, SCREAM FOR HALP! Someone's more peaceful mind and cleaner look will slay the beast. **Ego is expensive**. Help is cheap-ish. Use it.\n\n### Break it into dopamine shots\n\nLet’s sit with dopamine for a moment &mdash; because realizing how this 🤬 thing works is the difference between **owning** procrastination and being **pwned** by it.\n\nDopamine isn’t a *pleasure chemical* (like oxytocin, which makes hugs and group projects feel good, or endorphins, which flood in after a run); it’s a *prediction* and *motivation* molecule. It surges when your brain **forecasts a potential reward** &mdash; not necessarily when you actually get it. Can you now see *why* you pick the tasks you pick, or even *how* you pick them? Why *this* user story *feels* better than *that* boring one? Your brain cares more about the **chase** than the **catch**.\n\nThat’s why doomscrolling, inbox refreshing, and productive procrastination are incredibly treacherous. They dispense **variable dopamine hits**: \n\n- New Post!\n- Message Reply!\n- New Comment!\n- Slack Ping!\n\nThese keep you on the hook without ever giving genuine closure (i.e., finishing something meaningful).\n\nBut here’s the hack (not really a bio-hack, but you get the point): hijack dopamine *toward* what matters. Train your system to reward the process, not just the result.\n\nHow? Break big goals into **micro-tasks** you can ship fast. Did a small, meaningful change? `git commit`. Does a PR await merging? Go ahead &mdash; **merge it**. Close that ticket. Delete that TODO. Each tiny success delivers a clean *Oops, I did it again* hit &dash; real dopamine for real progress. Over time, your brain begins to prefer *steady micro-progress* over the empty calories of distraction.\n\n### Stubbornness plus movement\n\nI pace. I talk to myself. I go back and forth in my living room, ~~cursing~~ working through the problem out loud. Sometimes the solution isn't in the code. It's in getting your body moving and your mouth talking.\n\nNow, without too many technical shenanigans, this works because *walking* increases blood flow and basically wakes up the parts of your brain handling complex reasoning &mdash; not Neo Cortex, his younger brother, Prefrontal.\n\nEffectively *vocalizing* your thoughts is like sending a `nice` call on Linux; your working memory gets top priority, while all the other internal chatter (what’s for dinner, did I shut off the oven, is Obi-Wan Kenobi Leia's only hope) gets pushed down the queue.\n\nSuddenly your brain can actually focus on the problem at hand, because `movement + vocalizing` isn’t just a bad habit. It’s a way to prime your brain for the battle ahead: solving the problem in the best way possible.\n\n### Mood-aware task switching\n\nWhat if I can't concentrate, nobody's around for help, and I feel like hitting a wall? Science says your brain is probably in a **low dopamine / low motivation state**, which makes tackling big, hard problems brutal. Dark Souls, anyone?\n\nI switch to another small task, and here's the trick: if I'm in a self-destructive mood, I deliberately avoid the big, scary things. Instead, I focus on small wins (unblocking a process, writing a tiny PoC, sending status updates)anything that produces **fast, predictable dopamine hits**. These micro-progress tasks elevate mood and motivation, often within an hour or two, essentially performing a warm-reboot on the brain.\n\nThink of it like your brain’s own **OOM Killer**: when the big, heavy processes are blocking everything else, you temporarily kill low-priority tasks, let the small, manageable processes run, and regain enough headroom to attack the big problem without crashing.\n\nThen I return to the original problem, now reinforced and more determined. \n\nYour brain has gotten a mini reboot: prefrontal cortex ready, working memory unblocked, motivation back in play.\n\nIt never gets easier; you just figure out when your brain isn’t irradiated and ready to function.\n\n## The Eisenhower Unlock\n\nLearning to look at my tasks differently, changed everything for me:\n\nI follow the [Eisenhower Matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_management#Eisenhower_method) now. I delegate. I eliminate. I prioritize what must be done now versus what can wait. I split tasks so I can deliver quick wins. But more importantly, I learned to ask myself two questions:\n\n> Is this something that, if done by a colleague of mine, would actually benefit both of us?  \n\n\n> Do we really need to do this when there are a hundred other things on the backlog that, admittedly, have higher priority?\n\n|                     | **Urgent**                                      | **Not Urgent**                                |\n|---------------------|-------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|\n| **Important**       | **Quadrant I: Do First**\u003Cbr>Tasks that require immediate attention and have high impact. | **Quadrant II: Schedule**\u003Cbr>Tasks that are important but not time-sensitive. |\n| **Not Important**   | **Quadrant III: Delegate**\u003Cbr>Tasks that demand attention but do not significantly contribute to your goals. Best to delegate if possible. | **Quadrant IV: Eliminate**\u003Cbr>Tasks that are distractions or low-value activities. Ideally, minimize or remove these. |\n\n\nI used to procrastinate tasks that should have been delegated or eliminated. I'd let them sit in my queue, rotting, creating guilt and anxiety. Not anymore. Now I say:\n\n- We have other priorities right now. (*Do First*)\n- There is a critical production bug that we need to fix immediately. (*Do First*)\n- The system outage the customer reported needs our attention now. (*Do First*)\n- This doesn’t fit into the current sprint, we’ll schedule it later. (*Schedule*)\n- We’ll get to this in a best-effort way when we have the capacity. (*Schedule*)\n- Refactoring this core module is important, we’ll schedule it to prevent future issues. (*Schedule*)\n- This is perfect for the mentee to take on and learn from. (*Delegate*)\n- The new hire can handle this to get up to speed on the project. (*Delegate*)\n- This doesn’t align with our roadmap priorities. (*Eliminate*)\n- Experimenting with this new framework has no immediate payoff, so we’ll skip it. (*Eliminate*)\n\nDelegation isn't dumping work on someone else. It's **development**. It's recognizing that some tasks are better suited for others; either because they'll **learn from it**, because they have a **cleaner perspective**, or because you have **more important stuff to do**.\n\nAnd, yes, you **can** have more important stuff to do.\n\nElimination isn't laziness. It's **leadership**. It's saying *this doesn't deserve anyone's time right now*.  \n\nThe Matrix changed how I collaborate with my peers and crew. It changed how I look at what deserves my frustration… and what doesn't.\n\n## Tomorrow Comes in a Couple of Days\n\nLet's be honest: tomorrow *does* eventually come. Usually in a couple of days, driven by deadlines and guilt. That's one of the realities of professional software development.\n\nBut now I have tools. The 30-minute rule. The Eisenhower Matrix. The quick wins. The stubborn marching and vocalizing. The self-aware mood management. The willingness to scream for help before I've wasted half a day being frustrated.\n\nThe work doesn't get easier. The badly documented APIs don't magically improve. The boring tasks don't become fascinating. The user stories don't suddenly make sense.\n\nBut you get better at recognizing what deserves your frustration &mdash; and what doesn't.\n\nYou get better at catching yourself in the productive procrastination spiral before three weeks later becomes a crisis.\n\nYou get better at knowing when you're in the right headspace to tackle the hard problem versus when you should switch to something that'll reset your mood.\n\nYou get better at asking for help before the impostor syndrome and the \"I'm not good enough\" loop eats you alive.\n\nAnd sometimes, when the city sleeps and the lo-fi beats play and there's nothing but you and the code and the cold blue glow of your monitors, you remember why you started doing this in the first place.","src/content/blog/overcoming-procrastination-frustration-code-stagnation.md",[261],"../../assets/procrastination.webp","c3618c171268c265",{"html":264,"metadata":265},"\u003Cblockquote>\n\u003Cp>A badly documented API is worse than a completely undocumented API.\u003C/p>\n\u003C/blockquote>\n\u003Cp>There.

Not days. *Weeks*. And the wall hasn't moved. Not even a crack. It's a fact that you *can't win this fight*.\n\nWe'd been trying to modernize our storage architecture — migrating away from local disk to cloud-based solutions. Sounds simple, right? Well... so does *just deploy it to production*. On Friday afternoon. We all know how that goes.\n\nThe problem wasn't the code. It wasn't the complexity of AWS S3, CloudFront, and the like, or the intricacies of distributed storage. The problem was that we'd been approaching it like *individual warriors*, each fighting our own isolated battles. \n\n> Lone-wolf development had leeched our strength, and we mistook the weakness for progress.\n\n## The Solo Grind That Never Ends\n\nPicture this: Monday morning. Coffee in hand. Asana task loaded. `Migrate file storage to S3`. Heh, how hard could it be?\n\n*Monday afternoon*: Deeper rabbit hole than expected. Infrastructure concerns. Legacy code dependencies. Edge cases nobody documented.\n\n*Tuesday*: Different rabbit hole. Authentication issues. Permission models. *Why does this service need seventeen different policies?*\n\n*Wednesday*: Back to the first rabbit hole because Tuesday's \"fix\" broke Monday's progress.\n\n*Thursday*: Existential crisis. *Maybe I'm not cut out for this. Maybe I should have become a plumber. At least pipes don't have backward compatibility issues.*\n\n*Friday*: Productive procrastination. Answered emails. Updated documentation. Attended three meetings **about meetings**. Avoided the storage migration task like it had COVID.\n\nMaybe it sounds awfully familiar...\n\nThis is the *solo development death spiral*. Complex features (the ones that touch multiple systems, require deep architectural understanding, and have tentacles reaching into every corner of your application) aren't designed for solo work. They're *distributed problems* that require **distributed thinking**.\n\nBut, we keep trying to solo them anyway. Why? Because we've been conditioned to believe that great developers are *lone wolves*. That asking for help is weakness. That if you can't solve it alone, you're not senior enough.\n\nComplete and utter bullshit.\n\nWhen you're working alone on a complex feature, you're essentially context-switching between being the frontend developer, the backend developer, the DevOps engineer, the database architect, and the person who remembers why that weird edge case exists. \n\n> Oh! Isn't that the thing we call a *full-stack engineer*?\n\nEven if you're more than a full-stack engineer — think of it as a principal generalist — even if you *can* wear all those hats and then some, you're wearing them **one at a time**. And every hat switch costs you cognitive load.\n\nThe frustration compounds. The diminishing returns kick in. You start making trades: \n\n- \"I'll just hardcode this for now.\" \n- \"I'll refactor this later.\" \n- \"This technical debt is someone else's problem.\"\n\nAnd slowly, inevitably, you start bleeding. Energy. Motivation. Confidence. Time.\n\n## Assembling the Perfect Party\n\nIn our case, the breakthrough came during a work trip. Not in some conference room with a whiteboard and sticky notes. Not during a formal planning session. Just a couple of developers in a car, traveling toward the head office, talking casually.\n\n--- \n\n\"What if we used this?\"\n\n\"Yeah, I was thinking of the same thing\"\n\n\"Ah, let's sync with the crew once we reach the office and work on it in unison\"\n\n\"LGTM!\"\n\n---\n\nRevolutionary concept, right? *Work together*. On the same thing. At the same time.\n\nWe drove to the office with something that was less than a vague idea. Not a detailed architectural document. Not a formal project specification. Just an idea and the energy to try something different.\n\nWithin an hour, we had our crew assembled:\n\n- The Generalist - the one who could see the whole system\n- The Backend Guru - the one who actually knew where all the bodies were buried in our codebase\n- The Backend Prodigy - fresh perspective, the one that fixes all the issues, and pushes faster than their shadow\n- The DevOps Warrior - infrastructure focus, in process of ownership transfer and becoming the go-to person for CloudFrustration™.\n\nWe annexed the space under the stairs. Not some fancy conference room with whiteboards and ergonomic chairs. A small couch, two armchairs, and the chaotic energy of four developers who'd decided to stop bleeding individually and start bleeding together.\n\nFour laptops. Four people. Seven and a half eyes. Forty fingers. Same problem, different expertise domains. \n\nThe rules were deceptively simple:\n\n- Make one thing work at a time, *without breaking the others*\n- No side conversations, *full parallel work*\n- *Chaos communication* - if you see something, say something, **immediately**\n- Hackathon energy, collective ownership, **hive mind**\n\nLet's see what happens when distributed thinking becomes hive mind thinking.\n\n## The Moment Everything Clicked\n\nThe first twenty minutes were pure chaos; the problem by itself was chaotic and literally beyond the scope of this post. We had our requirements, we knew what were our goals, but the path to reaching them was as dark as any moonless night.\n\nFour laptops, four terminals, four different pieces of the same puzzle. The Backend Guru diving deep into the serving logic. The DevOps Warrior spinning up needed infrastructure so that we can work more efficiently. The Backend Prodigy implementing changes and pushing them. The Generalist orchestrating the chaos and ensuring the pieces would actually fit together.\n\nThis wasn't traditional mob programming. No single driver, no keyboard rotation, no careful turn-taking. This was parallel mob programming. Distributed thinking accelerated to hive mind speeds.\n\n---\n\n\"Uploading a file now, let's see\"\n\n\"Doesn't work\"\n\n\"Damn\"\n\n\"Switch to another approach\"\n\n---\n\nReal-time coordination without formal coordination. The Backend Guru would shout out a problematic piece of code, and the DevOps Warrior would make a check on the infrastructure to validate that a change in the code needed (or not) changes in the infrastructure. The Backend Prodigy would change things, commit and push, and the Generalist would suggest an architectural solution that the Backend Guru could implement immediately.\n\nWhen the first content was successfully displayed in our screens, without ANY quirk, we didn't just celebrate individually. We lost our collective minds as a unit.\n\n> IT WORKS 🤬🤬🤬!\n\nFour laptops. Forty fingers. One working proof of concept.\n\nBut here's the thing: the code we produced in those two hours wasn't just functional. It was *better* than what any of us would have written alone. Not because we were smarter together, but because we were thinking together.\n\nThe Backend Guru's deep understanding of legacy systems, combined with the DevOps Warrior's infrastructure expertise, combined with the Backend Prodigy's commitment to success, combined with the Generalist's architectural oversight. Each person operating in their domain of expertise while maintaining awareness of the whole system.\n\nHive mind development. Distributed cognition. Collective intelligence applied to code.\n\nThe difference wasn't **just** psychological anymore. It was qualitative. The solution was more robust, more thoughtful, more complete than the sum of its individual contributions. \n\nA much, much needed Proof of Concept which we should have done a long time ago.\n\n## Why Solo Development Bleeds You Dry\n\nSolo development on complex features is fundamentally **broken**. I've walked down that path a myriad times: Best-case scenario, an eternity later, you have something that (more-or-less) works, you deploy it, customers complain about a myriad bugs and shortcomings that you couldn't have imagined that will surface. Worst-case scenario? Feature is either sent to *development hell* or gets entirely *scrapped*. We've all been down that road as well.\n\nBy having experienced both the best and the worst case scenarios, I can tell you that there was a time that I literally went to my manager and declared that *I would stop contributing to features* and, instead, focus on fixing bugs, performing optimizations, writing post-mortems and dissecting problems. Back then I was frustrated by being either a lone wolf on the hunt for a new feature, or a cog in a machine that would not synchronize perfectly and, thus, underperform. \n\nIt was not the context-switching, though that was real. Having to switch from frontend, to backend, to third-party services, to product requirements, back to backend, write a test, perform a refactoring, fix one thing and **break four others**. When you are working alone on a feature that spans multiple domains, you are constantly *switching between different mental models*. Databases. API Architecture. Infrastructure. Error handling. Security Considerations. Performance. User Experience. Each switch costs cognitive energy. Each switch takes its toll on your ability to deliver.\n\nBut the real problem is deeper: To deliver a complex feature in time, you need parallel thinking, not sequential thinking. \n\nWhen we were working in *hive mind mode*, each entity in the hive mind could focus entirely on their own domain, while knowing that other domains and concerns were being handled simultaneously by another entity of the very same mind. The Backend Guru could focus on the serving logic, the DevOps Warrior would verify the infrastructure, the Backend Prodigy could explore potential fixes, without worrying about architectural consistency. The Generalist was maintaining system-level coherence in real time. \n\nWhen working alone, it is impossible to parallelize your cognitive abilities. You think about the application logic, then you *switch* to infrastructure, then you *switch* to error handling, then you *switch back* to the application logic. And all these without having the ability, in a background process, to maintain the coherence of the entire system in (near) real time.\n\nIn contrast, when working in hive mind mode, the cognitive load is truly distributed; not just divided, **distributed**. Each node of the cluster is thinking deeply in their own domain, while maintaining shared context about the overall system.\n\nThe emotional load changes too. When working alone, every obstacle is a personal challenge. Every failure reflects on your individual competence. Every breakthrough is a solo victory that nobody else fully understands and you've got nobody else to celebrate with.\n\nIn a hive mind, obstacles become *collective puzzles* that can be solved by exploiting each member's strengths. Every failure becomes a shared learning opportunity. Breakthroughs are group celebrations, with high fives, hugs and smiles. Photo opportunities. Collective memories. War stories.\n\n--- \n\n\"The S3 permissions are utterly screwed\".\n\n\"What's the error?\"\n\n\"Access denied, what else? But the policy looks right.\".\n\n\"Let me check the OAC... It's right.\"\n\n\"No, it's definitely not the OAC, it used to work with this exact same OAC.\"\n\n\"Does the cache behavior pass the cookies to the origin?\"\n\n\"🤬\"\n\n--- \n\nAn entire debugging session that would take an individual a couple of hours, was done in a couple of minutes. Not because the problem was simple; it really wasn't &mdash; it was the distribution of cognitive load on the team. One member asked a question, another threw an idea, the third one did the check, the fourth one verified that it worked. That was a shared victory, a reason to celebrate, a reason to fuel us work harder and deeper into fully unwinding the entire solution.\n\n> One brain, no matter how experienced, can't generate ideas at the same rate as four brains thinking in parallel about the same problem space.\n\n## Hive Mind Tricks\n\nFor complex features that span multiple domains, you need hive mind programming. The more the merrier, but be aware that there are diminishing returns. So, before picking your fight, its is essential to gather your party. \n\n### Setup for Chaos Coordination\n\nProximity is crucial for building and strengthening team bonds. We were literally under the stairs, close enough to overhear each other's thoughts, close enough to glance at each other's screens, close enough to immediately share discoveries. Four laptops, not one shared screen. Each person in their own domain, on their own laptop, with their own toolchain, hotkeys and tricks. Parallel work streams that intersect and coordinate organically.\n\nThe [Allen Curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allen_curve) demonstrates that communication frequency drops dramatically with physical distance. But there's more: physical proximity enables spontaneous interactions and, through physical touch like high-fives and celebratory gestures, increases oxytocin production, contributing to longer-term team bonding experiences.\n\nOne would ask, *wouldn't this work in a remote environment*? It can, but primarily when the team already shares strong bonds. Physical proximity is preferred when we need to build or strengthen those bonds — once the bonds are strong enough, any paradigm (on-premise, hybrid, remote) can work effectively.\n\n### Role-Based Parallel Processing\n\nWhile each person owns a domain &mdash; **must** do so, **must** bear the ownership to be able to go all-in &mdash; everyone maintains awareness of the whole system. While each one focuses on their own domain, the communication between the party allows everyone to understand enough about each other's domain. This allows everyone to know when their code decisions have, for example, deployment implications. This leads to a specialized focus with generalist awareness and that *is* the missing background process we really need when developing complex features, the background process that *maintains coherence*.\n\nThe less seasoned engineers aren't just learning from these experience &mdash; they are contributing specialized knowledge in their own areas, they come with fresher ideas, they gain system-level understanding through **osmosis**. More on **gaining experience through osmosis** in a future blog post.\n\n### Chaos Communication Protocols\n\n1. No **formal** communication structure.\n2. No **designated** facilitator\n3. No **careful** turn-taking\n4. Real-time ambient information sharing.\n\nInformation flows naturally based on relevance, timing and need, not based on formal coordination protocols. When someone discovers something that affects someone else's work, they share it immediately. When someone needs information from another domain, they ask immediately. \n\nThe coordination overhead is minimal, because the hive mind is self-coordinated, continuously, at a low-level, rather than periodically at a high level.\n\n### Fail Fast (Idea Speed) Hive Mind\n\nIn traditional development, failure has high switching costs. Even if you are accustomed to a *fail fast* scenario, you need to back out changes, reconsider alternatives, restart with a different strategy and maintain a system-level consistency.\n\nIn hive mind mode, failure has low switching costs, because multiple approaches are being explored simultaneously and, at the same time, the hive mind ensures system-level consistency. Via parallel exploration the risk is distributed throughout the crew and because everyone is checking the others' work, the resilience of the system becomes a collective objective.\n\n### Continuous Integration at Human Scale\n\nThe hive mind approach creates a natural **continuous integration** system between different work streams. When one makes a change that affects the API, the other immediately knows, because they are listening to the same ambient conversation. At that time they can evaluate if that works (CI passes) or raise their concerns to the group for discussion (CI fails). In any case, integration issues get caught and resolved immediately, not during some formal code review process, some hours or days later. The feedback loop is measured in minutes.\n\nAnd that's without needing a GitHub workflow for setting up a continuous integration pipeline; this is continuous integration between human cognitive processes. \n\n## Does it scale?\n\nAs previously mentioned, hive mind developing has its diminishing returns. We've tried it with four people, it could possibly work with more people, under specific circumstances. But, we need to understand that we have limited cognitive capacity, there are limitations in ingesting and processing information, especially when they come from domains that are different from the one we are specialized in and we need to have some understanding on them. \n\nOn larger groups there are two major issues: Cognitive overloading and communication breakdowns. And then there's [Brook's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooks%27s_law)\n\nSo, no. It does not scale indefinately.\n\nIt's also unsustainable to be in a hive mind mode for long periods of time. Both the mental, and the emotional toll on this mode are non-negligible. In such fast-paced, continuously evolving, filled with emotions sessions, it's very easy to burn out. \n\nSo, no. It does not scale indefinately.\n\nBut, we've already discussed distributed thinking and distributed systems and *you know where I'm heading to*.\n\nIt can be *parallelized*, but not in a fashion where different hive minds working of different aspects of a problem and having a sort-of connection between all of them.\n\nA hive mind approach is producing results fast, but not without its toll: You don't have the time to write tests, you don't have time to explore proper error handling, you don't have the time to focus on your domain's best practices. You have a problem to solve, you have to *hack and slash* throughout the jungles of uncharted territories, you have to cut all the corners. \n\nScaling is achieved via parallelization on another level: A team of selected warriors from each domain work in a hive mind in order to tackle a problem and discover solutions. These rough solutions, need to be sent for polishing by the respective teams, after the conclusion of a such session. One group works on charting the jungle of complexity and when they've discovered enough and settled on the specifics, they prepare the work for other teams. What needs to be done is now known, system-level consistency is guaranteed, architectural (and not only) decisions have been established. \n\nWhile the hive mind continues on exploring the unexplored lands of Code, Infrastructure, Requirements and User Experience, their teams can focus on working on the explored areas without having to worry about communicating with each other. They know what to do, because their delegate in the hive mind knows what's all about.\n\n## The Human Element in an AI-Generated World\n\nHere's what AI can't replicate (at least for the time being): the magic of forty fingers working on the same problem simultaneously.\n\nAI can suggest code solutions. It can generate architecture diagrams. It can even identify potential issues in isolation. But as of 2025, AI can't participate in hive mind development because AI doesn't have the parallel processing capabilities of multiple human minds working in coordination. Even if you spin a myriad of orchestrators, agents and subagents, the technology isn't there yet. Plus it needs human review. \n\nWhen the Backend Prodigy asked \"Why don't we just do Y instead of X?\", that wasn't just a technical suggestion. That was pattern recognition informed by their fresh perspective, social courage to challenge assumptions, and intuitive understanding of user impact. The combination of cognitive processes that led to that insight required human context that AI doesn't possess.\n\nThe Generalist's ability to maintain architectural coherence while three other developers worked in parallel, required *spatial reasoning*, *social awareness*, and real-time *cognitive load balancing*. Those are distinctly human capabilities.\n\nThe DevOps Warrior's infrastructure decisions were informed not just by technical requirements, but by understanding team capabilities, deployment constraints, and operational complexity. Context that exists in human relationships and organizational knowledge, not in code repositories.\n\nThe Backend Guru's deep understanding of the legacy code came from months of debugging edge cases, handling production incidents, and making incremental improvements. Experiential knowledge that can't be distilled into training data... yet!\n\nAI augments individual developer productivity. But hive mind development is about collective intelligence that emerges from human coordination, human communication, and human collaboration.\n\nThe junior developers' \"simple\" suggestions weren't just naive approaches that happened to work. They were insights generated by cognitive diversity - different experience bases, different problem-solving patterns, different risk assessments. The value wasn't in the individual suggestions, but in the collective evaluation and refinement of those suggestions by the whole hive mind.\n\nWhen we celebrated the successful S3 serving, we weren't just celebrating functional code. We were celebrating collective achievement. Shared ownership of both the struggle and the success. Psychological validation that complex problems can be solved through human coordination.\n\nThat emotional amplification - the energy that comes from breakthrough moments shared with people who understand exactly why it's a breakthrough - that's irreplaceable. That's what makes sustainable team development possible.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nTake your most complex feature. The one that's been bleeding you dry for weeks. The one that spans multiple systems, requires deep architectural understanding, and has tentacles reaching into every corner of your application.\n\nStop trying to solve it with sequential, single-threaded, solo development.\n\nAssemble your *hive mind*. Find your Generalist who can maintain system-level coherence. Find your domain expert who knows where the bodies are buried. Find your fresh perspectives who aren't yet convinced that the obvious solutions are impossible. Find your specialists who can work in parallel on different aspects of the same problem.\n\nSet up for *chaos coordination*. Proximity. Multiple laptops. Parallel work streams. Ambient communication. Collective ownership.\n\nMake *one thing work at a time*, without breaking the others. Let the cognitive load distribute naturally across different domains of expertise. Let the emotional load distribute across shared ownership and collective celebration.\n\nHit it until it bleeds. Until the barriers break down and the sequential bottlenecks become parallel throughput. Until the individual struggle becomes collective intelligence.\n\nThe solution isn't better individual heroics. It's better collective coordination.\n\nAnd when it works - when the proof of concept proves its concept and everyone's celebrating because **THE FUCK, IT WORKS** - remember that feeling. That's what hive mind development feels like. That's what distributed cognition feels like. That's what complex features feel like when you attack them with parallel human intelligence.\n\nNext time you're staring at a feature that's too big for one brain, remember: it's not supposed to fit in one brain. Some problems are designed for hive minds.\n\nFind your hive. Set up the chaos. Start coding. Until it bleeds.

One member asked a question, another threw an idea, the third one did the check, the fourth one verified that it worked.

We were literally under the stairs, close enough to overhear each other’s thoughts, close enough to glance at each other’s screens, close enough to immediately share discoveries. Four laptops, not one shared screen. Each person in their own domain, on their own laptop, with their own toolchain, hotkeys and tricks. Parallel work streams that intersect and coordinate organically.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The \u003Ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allen_curve\">Allen Curve\u003C/a> demonstrates that communication frequency drops dramatically with physical distance. But there’s more: physical proximity enables spontaneous interactions and, through physical touch like high-fives and celebratory gestures, increases oxytocin production, contributing to longer-term team bonding experiences.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>One would ask, \u003Cem>wouldn’t this work in a remote environment\u003C/em>? It can, but primarily when the team already shares strong bonds. Physical proximity is preferred when we need to build or strengthen those bonds — once the bonds are strong enough, any paradigm (on-premise, hybrid, remote) can work effectively.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"role-based-parallel-processing\">Role-Based Parallel Processing\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>While each person owns a domain — \u003Cstrong>must\u003C/strong> do so, \u003Cstrong>must\u003C/strong> bear the ownership to be able to go all-in — everyone maintains awareness of the whole system. While each one focuses on their own domain, the communication between the party allows everyone to understand enough about each other’s domain. This allows everyone to know when their code decisions have, for example, deployment implications. This leads to a specialized focus with generalist awareness and that \u003Cem>is\u003C/em> the missing background process we really need when developing complex features, the background process that \u003Cem>maintains coherence\u003C/em>.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The less seasoned engineers aren’t just learning from these experience — they are contributing specialized knowledge in their own areas, they come with fresher ideas, they gain system-level understanding through \u003Cstrong>osmosis\u003C/strong>.

Via parallel exploration the risk is distributed throughout the crew and because everyone is checking the others’ work, the resilience of the system becomes a collective objective.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"continuous-integration-at-human-scale\">Continuous Integration at Human Scale\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>The hive mind approach creates a natural \u003Cstrong>continuous integration\u003C/strong> system between different work streams. When one makes a change that affects the API, the other immediately knows, because they are listening to the same ambient conversation. At that time they can evaluate if that works (CI passes) or raise their concerns to the group for discussion (CI fails).

We’ve tried it with four people, it could possibly work with more people, under specific circumstances.

These rough solutions, need to be sent for polishing by the respective teams, after the conclusion of a such session. One group works on charting the jungle of complexity and when they’ve discovered enough and settled on the specifics, they prepare the work for other teams.

It can generate architecture diagrams. It can even identify potential issues in isolation. But as of 2025, AI can’t participate in hive mind development because AI doesn’t have the parallel processing capabilities of multiple human minds working in coordination.
