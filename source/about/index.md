Hello! I am Alexandros Koutroulis, a seasoned PHP developer from Greece, currently working for [Epignosis Learning Technologies](https://www.epignosishq.com/)! I also write short or longer stories, for the harsh side of reality, we all have experienced at a point in our lives. 

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning AWS, Modern Javascript & Typescript. Welcome to the 21st century!
- ðŸ¤” I wrote my first lines of code in VB4.0, back in 1995. Damn, that's a lifetime ago!
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything. If it's computer related, I will probably have a story to share. 
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/akoutroulis/)
