We have created AI that can solve the *how* of programming in **unprecedented, superhuman** speed. Yet, the *why* behind the *how* is more critical &mdash; and human &mdash; than ever. We all have heard the hype, seen the reels, watched someone build a very sophisticated application in mere hours or even minutes. What nobody says though, is that these are extraordinary and beautiful **houses of cards**. Can the new archetype of developers, the **Vibe Coder** vibe an entire fast, secure and robust e-commerce application?

Can the new archetype of developers &mdash; the **Vibe Coder** who flows with AI's creative suggestions and rapid iterations â€” actually vibe an entire fast, secure, and robust e-commerce application? I think not.

But I believe I know who could create such an application while abiding by all constraints, using mostly or solely AI tools.

## The Great Inversion

In real world scenarios, one doesn't only have to be knowledgeable on their craft; they need to be experienced as well. *Experience Matters*. It's all the war stories you have gathered, all the nights you couldn't sleep, all the arguments you had with colleagues and friends, all the decisions, the failures and the successes. One's experience can be passed down to another as knowledge. And our collective knowedge, as a species, has been fed into large language models. The inherent limitation of LLMs? They **cannot obtain experience**.

Take me for example. I've been working as a web developer for a couple of years. I take pride in knowing my craft and having experience on a number of related-ones. I can not only write code, but also set up my infrastructure, optimize databases and applications, craft APIs, the likes. However there are certain fields I have no-experience whatsoever and only some working knowledge. While I know, in theory, how queuing mechanisms work, I've never implemented one by myself. I *lack the experience*.

Today's AI has made the *how* questions trivial: *How can I refactor this synchronous code to be event driven?*. It will give me some suggestions: *Use Valkey's [Pub/Sub](https://valkey.io/topics/pubsub/)*. I know (again, in theory) how Pub/Sub works, so why it took me three days of painstaking debugging to make something simple work? Because I was missing the *why* in the equation.

The **How** is a colloquialism for syntax, implementation patterns, debugging, speed-learning, getting answers to questions, and so on. The things any descent, experienced developer, can perform albeit at a much slower rate than an AI. The **Why** though are all things that fire debates and arguments, require collecive brainstorming, settling on decisions and disscussed over beers: Architectural Decisions, Business Logic, Edge Cases, Trade Offs, Development Decision, What's in Scope and What not. While all of these were important before the Generative AI / Vibe Coding era, they are paramount nowadays. Are you really sure that you want an AI to make the architectural decisions for you? If so, ask yourself, *why?*.

We've entered the Vibe Coding era and there's no turning back. I like to think it as an advance much like to sending Gagarin to space. 


- How AI has flipped the traditional programming paradigm
- "How" questions (syntax, implementation patterns, debugging) become trivial
- "Why" questions (architecture decisions, business logic, trade-offs) become paramount
- The emergence of the sage programmer archetype

## The Wisdom Prerequisites

- What kind of experience transforms a coder into a sage programmer
- Domain knowledge vs. technical knowledge
- Pattern recognition at the system level
- The ability to ask the right questions of an AI agent
- War stories: when experience saves the day

## The Dangerous Illusion of Democratization

- Why "anyone can code now" is a seductive but perilous myth
- Case studies of AI-generated code gone wrong due to poor guidance
- The hidden complexity of seemingly simple requests
- Technical debt as the price of inexperienced AI guidance

## Cultivating the Sage Mindset

- How experienced developers can evolve their role
- From writing code to orchestrating intelligence
- The new core competencies: systems thinking, business acumen, architectural vision
- Teaching AI vs. being replaced by AI


## The Sage's New Kingdom

- AI hasn't eliminated the need for expertise - it's elevated it
- The sage programmer as the bridge between human intention and machine capability
- A call to embrace wisdom over wizardry


Key Thematic Elements to Weave Throughout:
The Sage Archetype

Reference wisdom traditions, mentorship, the difference between knowledge and understanding
The sage as someone who knows not just what to do, but when not to act

Why vs. How Dialectic

Constantly return to this central tension
Use it to frame each section's arguments
Show how mastering "why" has always separated good programmers from great ones

Philosophical Depth

Questions about the nature of creativity and authorship
The relationship between tools and craftspeople
What it means to be "intelligent" in an age of artificial intelligence
